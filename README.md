### Overview

This package is a library designed to simplify automation of Android and iOS mobile applications using Appium.

You've got to use this set of methods, related to most common actions performed with web elements.

Most of performed methods are logged using LOG4J, so you can easily see a history of performed actions in your log.

We use interfaces where is possible, so you can implement your own version of target interface with no need to rewrite other classes.
